# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value Based on Multi-Channel Marketing Campaign Engagement

## Overview

This project analyzes historical multi-channel marketing campaign data to predict customer lifetime value (CLTV) and identify the most effective marketing channels and campaign elements.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the development of a predictive model to forecast CLTV based on customer engagement with various marketing channels. The goal is to provide actionable insights for optimizing future marketing campaigns and maximizing return on investment (ROI).

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

## Example Output

The script will print key findings from the data analysis to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of customer engagement across different channels.
* Key correlations between campaign elements and CLTV.
* Performance metrics of the trained predictive model (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).

Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `channel_performance.png`) in the `output` directory, illustrating trends in sales, channel effectiveness, and other relevant insights.  These visualizations provide a visual representation of the key findings.
